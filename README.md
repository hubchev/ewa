# Empirisch-wissenschaftlich Arbeiten (ewa)

This repo hosts content related to the "Empirisch-wissenschaftlich Arbeiten (ewa)" course at Charlotte Fresenius Hochschule.

To execute all scripts and compile R Markdown files, use the main script named "run_all.R" located in the "scripts" directory.

A prerequisite for running this script is having the "data" directory. Unfortunately, the files of this folder are not available on GitHub as it contains data sourced from https://doi.org/10.4232/1.13978, and you need to register (free of charge) there to download the data. Students enrolled in the course can access the relevant data on studynet.

The "data" directory should include, at a minimum, the following files:
- ModKogDat.csv
- ModKogDat3F.csv
- ZA7558_v2-0-0.dta.zip
- ZA7558_v2-0-0.sav
 
You can either clone the repo with 

`git clone https://github.com/hubchev/ewa`

or you can unzip the zipped file `ewa.zip`.
