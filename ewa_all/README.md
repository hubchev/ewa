# Empirisch-wissenschaftlich Arbeiten (ewa)

I host stuff here that relates to the course Empirisch-wissenschaftlich Arbeiten (ewa) at the Charlotte Fresenius Hochschule.

To run all scripts and compile all R Markdown files you should run the main script which I called "run_all.R". It is in the directory "scripts".

A prerequisite to run this script is that you have the "data" directory. Unfortunately, this folder is not on Github as it contains data taken from https://doi.org/10.4232/1.13978 and you need to register (free of costs) there to download the data. Students of the subject can download the respective data from `studynet`.

The data directory should at least contain the following files:
- ModKogDat.csv
- ModKogDat3F.csv
- ZA7558_v2-0-0.dta.zip
- ZA7558_v2-0-0.sav
